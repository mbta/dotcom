/**
 * One-off test suite to verify that responses come with various
 * security-related headers. This doesn't necessarily verify relevant or
 * correct values, only that the headers are present at all.
 * 
 * This was inspired by a security audit which uncovered some gaps. The
 * particular requests being made in this tests are the same reported in the
 * audit. The particular headers being verified also correspond to the ones
 * from the audit.
 * 
 * This test doesn't need to run regularly, but if adjusting the configuration
 * of returning security headers, running this script offers some peace of
 * mind.
 * 
 * Defaults to running against localhost, but can run against any site using
 * the HOST environment variable, e.g.
 * 
 * HOST=dev.mbtace.com npx playwright test security-headers
