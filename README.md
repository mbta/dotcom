# Dotcom

The new face of https://www.mbta.com/. 

## Supported browsers 

We strive to support all users – but the variety of browsers, operating systems and devices available necessitates a more intentioned approach. Generally speaking, Dotcom supports the stable latest releases of all major web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Microsoft Edge) and platforms (Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android). 
Other interfaces using the underlying engines of the aforementioned browsers – that's WebKit, Blink, Gecko – are not explicitly supported but are expected to function correctly.

From a development standpoint, polyfills and code transforms are implemented via [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-preset-env.html#browserslist-integration) with the target browsers noted in [the site .browserslistrc](assets/.browserslistrc).

## Getting Started

Welcome to [Dotcom](https://www.notion.so/mbta-downtown-crossing/Dotcom-6aa7b0f0258446a197d35b1f05d90e96). There are more [details and background information in this Notion document](https://www.notion.so/mbta-downtown-crossing/Engineering-db62977f905347bab6fe94a2249a8a05), but read on to get started on your setup!

1. Request a V3 API key at https://api-dev.mbtace.com/. After getting an API key, it's customary to click "request increase" for your key's 'Per-Minute Limit'.

1. Install [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation.html):
    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

1. Install [asdf package version manager](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
   * Follow the instructions on https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf
     
     ```shell
     brew install asdf
     ```
   * Install the necessary tools to set up asdf plugins:

     ```shell
     brew install gpg gawk # for nodejs plugin
     brew install autoconf openssl@1.1 # for erlang plugin
     brew install wxwidgets # optional for erlang for building with wxWidgets (start observer or debugger!)
     brew install libxslt fop # optional for erlang for building documentation and elixir reference builds
     ```

   * Add asdf plugins

     ```
     asdf plugin add erlang
     asdf plugin add elixir
     asdf plugin add nodejs
     ```
     You can verify the plugins were installed with `asdf plugin list`.

     While Erlang, Elixir, and NodeJS are essential for any development on Dotcom.

     You're welcome to add more plugins for personal use! But these are the ones set up in `.tool-versions` and invoked in the next step:

   * Now run the install:

     ```
     asdf install
     ```

   * Verify that all the languages for our setup were installed:

     ```
     asdf current
     ```

     You should see the following output with versions specified from `.tool-versions`:

     ```
      elixir         <version> (set by ~/dotcom/.tool-versions)
      erlang         <version> (set by ~/dotcom/.tool-versions)
      nodejs         <version> (set by ~/dotcom/.tool-versions)
      ...
     ```

     If you are missing any versions, you should re-run `asdf install`.

     You may have to individually install each version
     ```
     asdf install plugin_name <version> (set by ~/dotcom/.tool-versions)
     ```

1. Install our Elixir dependencies. From the root of this repo:
    ```
    mix deps.get
    ```


1. Install our Node dependencies. From the root of this repo:
    ```
    npm run install
    ```
    You won't see a `node_modules` folder at the root of this project -- this installs packages into `assets`.

    Minor note - you may see a prompt to upgrade `npm`. This isn't needed, and `"lockfileVersion": 1` in our `assets/package-lock.json` file means it was generated with an `npm` version prior to 7.


1. Set up required environment variables:
    ```
    cp .env.template .env
    ```
   Then uncomment the `MBTA_API_KEY` line and fill it in with the key you obtained
   in the first step. If you have [direnv] installed (recommended), it will automatically load
   and unload the environment using this file. If not, `source .envrc` will load
   or update the variables in your shell session manually.

[direnv]: https://github.com/direnv/direnv

For details on environment configuration, including optional variables, see
[ENVIRONMENT.md](docs/ENVIRONMENT.md).

## Running the Server

To run the server, you'll need to have a Redis instance running. You can either install it manually, or run it via Docker:

``` shell
docker run --rm -p 6379:6379 redis:7.2.4
```

Then, start the server with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Then, visit the site at http://localhost:4001.

## Algolia

[Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) powers our search features. Sometimes after content updates or GTFS releases we will find that the search results do not contain up-to-date results. When this happens you can re-index the Algolia data by running: `mix algolia.update`.

## Integration Tests

```
npm install --ignore-scripts
npx playwright test all-scenarios
```

You can run a single test (and optionally use `--debug` or `--ui`):

```
npx playwright test all-scenarios --grep @search_for_a_subway_line
```

## Load Tests

```
npm install --ignore-scripts
npx artillery run ./integration/load_tests/all-scenarios.yml --target http://localhost:4001
```

## Monitoring

```
npm install --ignore-scripts
npx pm2-runtime ./integration/monitor/ecosystem.config.js
```
